# [Guarded Suspension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarded_suspension) 模式

> In `concurrent programming` , `guarded suspension` is a `software design pattern` for managing operations that require both a lock to be acquired and a precondition to be satisfied before the operation can be executed. The guarded suspension pattern is typically applied to method calls in object-oriented programs ,and involves suspending the method call, and the calling thread , until the precondition (acting as a guard ) is satisfied.
